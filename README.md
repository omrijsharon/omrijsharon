- @omrijsharon 
- Working on: 
  - Autonomous FPV/racer drones: simulations, control, planning, perception.
  - MoCoGlove: a motion control glove that acts as a controller for FPV drones.
  - IR FPV system (LaserTag dogfights, Racing timers, etc...). With MSP OSD (BetaFlight, iNav compatible).
  - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with agent-agent/s communication.
  - Extending Pytorch with easy to use implementations such as: HyperNetworks, MDN, Complex tensors and operators/layers, sharpened cosine similarity with loss, etc...
- Will be happpy to collaborate on projects including multi-agents.
