  - Autonomous FPV/racer drones: simulations, control, planning, perception.
  - MoCoGlove: a motion control glove that acts as a controller for FPV drones, BLE MIDI controller, etc...
  - IR FPV system (LaserTag dogfights). With MSP OSD (BetaFlight, iNav compatible).
  - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with agent-agent/s communication.
  - LM Music producer.
  - Extending Pytorch with easy to use implementations such as: HyperNetworks, MDN, Complex tensors and operators/layers, sharpened cosine similarity with loss, etc...
- Will be happpy to collaborate on any of these projects!
