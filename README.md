- @omrijsharon 
- Working on: 
  - Autonomous fpv/racer drones: simulations, control, planning, perception.
  - GyroGlove: a remote control glove for fpv.
  - Laser Tag for FPV drones (showing game parameters on the OSD, shooting with the RC).
  - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with agent-agent/s communication.
  - Extending Pytorch with easy to use implementations such as: HyperNetworks, MDN, Complex tensors and operators/layers, sharpened cosine similarity with loss, etc...
- Will be happpy to collaborate on projects including multi-agents.
